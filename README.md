# My-Automation-Project
In this project we had to check the registration process of a demo version for a website.
At the begining we enterd the homepage automatically in order to check if the website appears.
Secondly, we made an automatically registration process in order to see if there are no bugs in that process. 
The tests were performed in JAVA code via Selenium, Maven and Junit.
